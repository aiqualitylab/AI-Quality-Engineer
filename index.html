  <p>This page outlines a roadmap for organizations looking to integrate Generative AI (GenAI) into their software testing processes. It emphasizes the importance of a well-defined strategy that considers test objectives, LLM selection, data quality, and compliance. The document also addresses the risks associated with "Shadow AI" and provides guidance on selecting appropriate LLMs/SLMs for specific testing tasks. Finally, it describes a phased approach to GenAI adoption, from initial discovery to full utilization.</p>

  <p>AI systems are typically a blend of AI components, such as machine learning models, and non-AI components, like APIs, databases, or UI layers. Testing the non-AI parts of these systems is similar to testing traditional software. Standard techniques like boundary testing, equivalence partitioning, and automation can be applied effectively.</p>
